## Panarion

_“In the 4th century, Epiphanius of Salamis wrote the Panarion - literally, the ‘box of remedies’ - a compendium of cures against false teachings.
This modern Panarion offers a different kind of medicine: a curated set of free and open-source tools that heal our digital lives from dependence on closed, extractive systems.
Open technologies are not only freer - they are often more secure, more transparent, and simply work better.”_

In an age where technology often breeds dependency, these open tools restore autonomy and understanding. They are the quiet antidote to black boxes, subscriptions, and artificial scarcity, built by communities, not corporations. Each project is a remedy: for lost privacy, constrained creativity, and systems that no longer serve their users. Together they form a living kit for digital self-reliance,  a reminder that openness isn’t just ethical, it’s practical. It’s how things should work.

**Panarion** is a curated collection of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) tools and resources for self-hosting, privacy, and digital autonomy, a compact reference for building your own independent tech ecosystem.
